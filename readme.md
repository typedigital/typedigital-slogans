# Introduction

This is library that lists all of the silly phrases used for the [typedigital](https://typedigital.de/) website. 
Upon clicking on the company logo found in the top left corner it will change to a combination of two words beginning with T and D respectively. E.g. typedigital -> thatdoge. It has been launched externally so that anyone with a funny idea can add that to the website by contributing to this small project.

# Contributing

If you have an idea that you want to add to our website feel free to simply open up a pull request and add it to the already existing list. 
The only rules you have to follow are the following: 

 - adhere to the format: 2 words, first one beginning with T, second one with D
 - don't defame, discirmiate or hurt anyone. These expressions are supposed to be fun and not disrespectful. Feel free to meme, like us.

This Project is released under the unilicence and we treat every contribution as such.
