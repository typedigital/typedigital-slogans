# Introduction

This is library that lists all of the silly phrases used for the [typedigital](https://typedigital.de/) website. 
Upon clicking on the company logo found in the top left corner it will change to a combination of two words beginning with "t" and "d" respectively. E.g. typedigital -> thatdoge. It has been launched externally so that anyone with a funny idea can add that to the website by contributing to this small project.

# Contributing

If you have an idea that you want to add to our website feel free to simply open up a pull request and add it to the already existing list. 
The only rules you have to follow are the following: 

 - adhere to the format: 2 words, first one beginning with "t", second one with "d"
 - don't defame, discirmiate or hurt anyone. These expressions are supposed to be fun and not disrespectful. Feel free to meme like us.
